// Embedded rather than shipped as a file next to the install, and served at
// runtime rather than copied into a project, for one reason: instructions that
// live anywhere else go stale against the CLI they describe. A stub in
// .claude/skills that runs `anoa skills get core` always describes the binary
// that is actually installed.
