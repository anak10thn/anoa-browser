# anoa in a container: a headless browser with a CDP endpoint and the agent CLI.

# Built from the published release tarball rather than from source. The tarball
# is what users actually get, so an image built from it exercises the same
# artifact — and the alternative is compiling Qt WebEngine, which turns a
# one-minute build into an hour.

# Chromium dlopen()s regardless — they resolve outside the bundle's RPATH, so
# they cannot be vendored with it.
